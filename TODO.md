# TODO

Open, cross-cutting decisions to revisit. Code-level TODOs live in comments;
deferred features live in the CHANGELOG. This file is for design choices that are
shipped one way but not yet settled.

## Open decisions

- **Modern (non-`find`) default time format: resolved to `space`.**
  `space` (`2026-06-22 14:30:00 +0100`) is the default: human-first (it matches
  GNU `ls --time-style=long-iso`/`full-iso` and `git log --date=iso`), still ISO-
  ordered so it sorts lexicographically, and parseable back by `ParseTimeString`.
  `--time-format` (config phase D4b) makes this a soft choice rather than a
  lock-in: `rfc3339` (`2026-06-22T14:30:00+01:00`) is one flag
  (`--time-format=rfc3339`) or one `.xffrc` line (`common: --time-format=rfc3339`)
  away for interchange-by-default, and machine consumers use `--format=jsonl`.
  (find's `-printf %t`, once implemented (#48), uses `asctime` per find.)

- **`--timezone` scope and spelling.**
  Shipped (config phase D4a) as `--timezone=ZONE`: overrides the zone used both
  to _interpret_ time-string arguments (`-newerXt`) and to _format_ time fields
  (`{atime}`/`{mtime}`/`{ctime}`/`{btime}`). Accepts `local`/empty,
  `utc`/`z`/`zulu`, and IANA names (`America/New_York`); an unknown zone is a
  usage error. The companion `--time-format=NAME` selector shipped alongside it
  (config phase D4b), and `-printf` (`%a`/`%c`/`%t` + `%Ak`/`%Ck`/`%Tk`) and `-ls`
  both render in the zone (#48). Both follow-ups have now shipped (with the #70
  datetime growth): (a) the `--tz=ZONE` short alias of `--timezone=ZONE`; (b)
  fixed-offset specs (`+05:30`, `-0800`, `+01`), which `ParseTimeZone` builds via
  `absl::FixedTimeZone` since `absl::LoadTimeZone` cannot parse them.

- **Project `.xffrc` per-entry subtree scoping (deferred).**
  The cascade (config phase E2a) reads, for each search root, every `.xffrc` from
  the filesystem root down to the root's directory (ancestors), applied run-level.
  The design (design-config.md L41, L56-58) also wants gitignore-style _subtree_
  scoping: a `.xffrc` in a directory _below_ a root should apply only to that
  subtree -- which means config resolution would vary per directory during the
  walk, an architectural change (per-entry layering on the traversal hot path).
  Deferred until a real need appears; the ancestor cascade already covers the
  common "repo + parents" case.

## Remaining work

The backlog of features and infrastructure not yet built. Ordered by current
intent, not hard dependency. Task numbers reference the agent task list.

### Lint / CI / style adoption (from helly25/mbo)

- **Style docs + `.clang-tidy`** (this change). `.clang-tidy` (mbo's rule set),
  `STYLE_CPP.md`, `RULES.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, and an
  `AGENTS.md` pointer. The `bazel-compile-commands-extractor` dev module is
  already wired (`bazelmod/dev.MODULE.bazel`), so clang-tidy can run locally.
- **Apply clang-tidy.** `bazel run @bazel_compile_commands_extractor//:refresh_all`
  to produce `compile_commands.json`, run `clang-tidy` across `xff/`, and fix the
  findings (likely several PRs sized by finding count).
- **Adopt trunk.** `.trunk/trunk.yaml` (+ `configs/`) and a CI `trunk` job
  mirroring mbo: clang-tidy (CI-skipped without a compile DB, gated locally),
  buildifier, markdownlint, prettier, yamllint, trivy/trufflehog, git-diff-check.
- **Adopt pre-commit.** `.pre-commit-config.yaml` (+ `.pre-commit/` scripts) and a
  CI `pre-commit` job: clang-format (mirrors-clang-format), shfmt, shellcheck,
  actionlint, and the local hooks (`no-do-not-merge`, `no-todos-without-context`,
  `done-gate-covers-all-jobs`, the no-em-dash check). Retire the hand-rolled
  clang-format CI step once pre-commit owns it.

### find / xff features (roadmap tail)

The standard find predicate surface is complete (the access predicates
`-readable` / `-writable` / `-executable`, `-inum` / `-samefile`, symbolic `-perm`
modes, `-lname` / `-ilname`, and `-fstype`; all in the CHANGELOG and covered by the
engine unit test), as is the reusable markdown-table-alignment skill (#66). What
remains below is the design-forked / larger work.

- **Parallel traversal + `--jobs` + deterministic `--sort`** (#43). Built: a
  worker-pool walk (`ReadPool`, `absl::Mutex`; parallel `readdir`+`lstat` on workers,
  single-thread coordinator/visitor) with `--sort=none|dir|subtree|tree`
  (`absl::c_sort`), `-j N` / `--jobs=all`, mode-scoped defaults, unit-tested across
  worker counts plus a tsan CI cell. Remaining: a CLI-level bashtest exercising
  `--sort` / `-j` end to end, then close #43/#27.
- **Exit-code model refinement + `--skip-unsupported` + impossible-task-fail**
  (#44). Shipped: (a) match-sensitive exit -- the default stays find semantics
  (0 ran / 2 error, match status never affects exit), while `--quiet` (suppress
  output, exit by match) and `--exit-match` (keep output, exit by match) make
  "1 = no match" reachable; an error still outranks match status (exit 2). (b)
  impossible-task-fail -- a predicate that cannot be evaluated correctly on an
  entry's FS (e.g. `-Btime` where birth time is unrecorded) is a hard error
  (exit 2), reported once; `--skip-unsupported` downgrades it to a warning + skip.
  Still open: the grep-compat `-q` short alias of `--quiet` (single-dash whole-run
  flag tensions with the dash-count convention -- decide before adding); and
  extending impossible-task detection beyond birth time (only `-Btime`/`-Bmin`/
  X=B `-newerXY` flag it today; a Y=B reference with no btime stays a silent
  no-match, and other FS-capability gaps are not yet modelled).
- **`--exact` + `--path-encoding`** (#45). Decided (2026-06-28): the **default is
  the filesystem-native, naturally-expected behavior** - matching follows the
  volume's own case-sensitivity (case-insensitive on a folding FS like APFS / HFS+ /
  NTFS, case-sensitive on ext4 and friends), so most users get what they expect on
  their platform; **`--exact` opts out** to force verbatim byte-for-byte comparison
  regardless of the FS. Needs a `vfs` case-sensitivity probe
  (`pathconf(_PC_CASE_SENSITIVE)` / statfs flags; conservative byte-exact fallback
  when unknown). Separately, **`--path-encoding=raw|escape`** governs how
  non-printable / invalid-UTF-8 path bytes render in plain / `--template` output
  (`raw` = find-compatible default; `escape` = C-style `\xNN`, like `ls -b`);
  `--format=jsonl` already escapes.
- **`--feature=NAME` / `--feature=no-NAME` capability gates** (#73). **Parked** - no
  concrete customer yet (valued knobs like `--implicit-print` / `--capture-override`
  / `--exec-fields` are dedicated flags by design, and whole-behavior switches are
  `--config` styles), so building it now is infrastructure without a user. **Design,
  ready to build the moment a boolean capability appears:** repeatable on/off dials
  resolved after the style/config defaults and before explicit dedicated flags
  (explicit wins); a **feature registry mirroring the descriptor/globals SOT** (each
  feature = name + one-line summary + default-per-style) so unknown `--feature=X`
  errors and `--help` / `--man` / `--markdown` list features automatically;
  `--explain` shows each feature's resolved value + origin; a style is just a named
  bundle of feature defaults (design-config.md L162-165). **Trigger (also in
  AGENTS.md):** the first boolean user-toggleable capability that is neither a style
  behavior nor a valued option must be built as the first `--feature`, not a bespoke
  flag.
- **Grow `xff/datetime` into a parse+format lib** (#70): named formats, field
  modifiers, and the `--time-format` / `--timezone` global flags have shipped, as
  have the last deferred pieces -- the `--tz` short alias and fixed-offset zone
  specs (`+05:30` / `-0800` / `+01`). Nothing outstanding here.
- **Mode mechanism** (#54). **Subsumed by `--config`:** `--config=find|xff` is the
  style/mode selector (#72) and `argv[0]` dispatch picks the default (#59);
  design-config.md L159 deliberately folds `--style` / `--mode` into `--config`, and
  `--config=xff:2` gives version epochs a binary `--modern` cannot. No separate
  `--mode` flag; the `--modern` umbrella stays deferred.
- **Full help system** (grow the `--help` overview shipped in #171). The CLI is
  flag-only -- no subcommands (decided 2026-06-28; xff is a single-purpose tool like
  fd/ripgrep, so find and xff keep one grammar). Shipped (#184): `--help=NAME` topic
  help and `--help=`/`=list`/`=all` index, both read from `registry::All()` + the
  per-descriptor `summary` (#181); GNU-compatible `-help`/`-version`; and a guiding
  error when a `help`/`version` operand is typed out of git habit (xff flavor).
  Remaining:
  - **Global-flag and config topics.** `--help=NAME` covers expression primaries
    today; extend it to global flags (`--help=--config`, `--help=--sort`, ...), which
    needs the globals enumerated the way `registry::All()` enumerates primaries (the
    globals are not in the registry yet).
  - **Explain the config system + flavor selection in depth** (in `--help`/topic
    help): config layering / precedence, `.xffrc` discovery, `--config` /
    `--no-config` / `--xffrc` / `--explain`, and **especially flavor selection by
    alias / sym-linking** (the `argv[0]` dispatch: invoked as `find` -> strict find,
    as `xff` -> modern; explicit `--config` overrides).
  - **Generated reference docs from the same registry SOT.** Drive docs off
    `registry::All()` (+ the globals table, once enumerated) rather than maintaining
    parallel copies:
    - **Man page on demand**: emit roff/troff (so `man -l -` / a packaged `man xff`
      works) via a flag, e.g. `--man` / `--man=TOPIC`, generated at runtime from the
      registry + the global-flag table + the config docs.
    - **Integrated Markdown documentation build**: emit a `.md` reference of all
      primaries / flags from the same source (an integrated mode and/or a build
      target; a separate external generator alongside the man-page builder is fine if
      need be). Wire it into CI so the committed docs cannot drift from the vocabulary.
- **Extended logical operators**: shipped. `-xor` / `-nand` / `-nor` / `-xnor` are
  xff extensions (find has only `-a`/`-and`, `-o`/`-or`, `-not`/`!`), with the
  conventional precedence `NOT > AND/-nand > XOR/-xnor > OR/-nor`; the strict find
  style rejects them. (`-xor` matches exactly one side; the rest are the negations
  of and/or/xor.)
