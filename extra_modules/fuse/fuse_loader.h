// The runtime gate of the FUSE extra (epic #183): whether THIS machine can mount at all.
//
// There is deliberately no build-time libfuse dependency. FUSE is a per-machine capability - on
// macOS it is a kernel component the user installs (macFUSE), on Linux a library that may or may
// not be present - so the library is dlopen'ed at first use and every fuse3 lowlevel symbol the
// mount server needs is resolved then. One binary runs everywhere; where the library is absent,
// `--archive-mount` degrades to extraction and this loader says why.
//
// Scope: the FUSE3 API only. macFUSE installations that ship only the legacy fuse2 library report
// unavailable (with the library name in `error()`); supporting the fuse2 lowlevel API is a separate
// decision to take when a real macFUSE user appears, not a default.
