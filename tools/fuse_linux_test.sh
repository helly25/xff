# Run the FUSE tests on LINUX, from a mac, before pushing.
#
# Why this exists: macOS has no fuse3, so every mounting test SKIPS here - `bazel test` goes green
# without executing a line of the kernel path. That is not a theoretical gap: --archive-mount (#183)
# shipped a use-after-free and an aborted-mount bug that only Linux CI could see, and each round trip
# cost minutes. This runs the same tests in a container with /dev/fuse, in seconds.
#
# Needs a Linux VM with docker (colima works: `colima start`). The bazel cache lives in a named
# volume, so the first run builds and later runs are fast.
#
#   tools/fuse_linux_test.sh          # functional: the fuse tests + the CLI mount test, sandboxed
#   tools/fuse_linux_test.sh tsan     # the CLI mount test under ThreadSanitizer
#   tools/fuse_linux_test.sh msan     # the fuse tests under MemorySanitizer, EMULATED x86_64
#
# TSan note: this harness is aarch64 on Apple silicon, where TSan needs reduced ASLR entropy or it
# aborts with "unexpected memory mapping" before running anything - hence --privileged and the
# sysctl. The repo's own --config=tsan is not used because it pulls the hermetic x86_64 clang
# toolchain, which has no aarch64 build; the sanitizer is driven through the container's gcc.
#
# MSan note: msan runs the REPO's own --config=msan, because MSan is the one sanitizer whose result
# depends on the instrumented libc++ overlay - and that overlay ships x86_64-linux only (see
# MSAN_LIBCXX_URL in bazelmod/llvm.MODULE.bazel). So this mode forces an x86_64 container, which on
# Apple silicon means qemu emulation: correct but SLOW, and the first run pays for the hermetic
# LLVM too. It gets its own cache volume because the toolchain is a different architecture.
# It earns the wait: every mounting test must SKIP under MSan (the dlopened system libfuse3 is
# uninstrumented, so its bytes read back as uninitialized), and forgetting one of those skips is a
# mistake only this cell catches.
